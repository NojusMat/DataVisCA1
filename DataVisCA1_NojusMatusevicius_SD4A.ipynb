This topic was chosen because of the growing demand for software engineers worldwide and for my own personal reason as i want to emigrate once i graduate as a software engineer. It's important for new graduates to know what country will offer them the best opportunity for their career allowing them to develop professionally and the best country regarding living standards.  \n",

These factors will have different levels of importance assigned to them with an overall combined score which will rank the countries on how good they would be to move to as a newly graduated software engineer.
